As these individuals may be brand new to coding, it is important that this webpage be inviting, interesting and informative.</p><h2 id=tasks-completed>Tasks Completed</h2><ul><li>Met with Lauren McCarthy and mentor to determine requirements for the new hello.p5.js website</li><li>Created a new code-base for the project using modern web tools (eg: Node, Browserify, Plyr)</li><li>Enabled multilingual captioning on video player using WebVTT files</li><li>Wrote code to toggle between languages using non-HTML video controls</li><li>Developed a survey to gather feedback from the community regarding what they use p5js for, and what they like about it</li><li>Promoted survey on Github, Processing Forum, and Twitter</li><li>Analyzed results, identified key features, and incorporated feedback into a video script</li><li>Drew video storyboards for feedback from mentor and Lauren</li><li>Designed UX wireframes to illustrate how p5.js sketches would be overlayed on video content, how captions would appear, and how users would control the video</li><li>Recorded draft video as proof of concept for the final project</li><li>Recruited volunteers for the video through a second online survey</li><li>Corresponded with community leaders to ensure diverse representation in the video</li><li>Promoted second survey on Github, Processing Forum, and Twitter</li><li>Coordinated video making tasks with members of the community</li><li>Coded and modified p5.js sketches to be overlaid on the video content</li><li>Secured Spanish and French translation for video content</li><li>Consulted media professionals to ensure high quality look and feel</li><li>Procured background music samples from several musicians and gathered feedback from mentor</li><li>Edited video clips together using Adobe Premier, Audition, and After Effects</li></ul><h2 id=challenges>Challenges</h2><ul><li>Crowdsourcing the video content was fun and filled with delightful suprises; however, it was challenging to coordinate video-making tasks with community members over the summer (e.g. tight GSOC time constraints, people’s summer vacations).</li><li>Creating a dynamic, post-production greenscreen effect was more difficult than I imagined. Using seriously.js for the canvas background removal worked well; however, setting videos to a neutral background color in After Effects was difficult without a neutral background.</li><li>When incorporating browserify to pre-process my javascript, I missed one crucial line of code. This required tremendous digging to figure out why it wouldn’t compile. It set me back several days, but I learned a lot!</li></ul><h2 id=contribution--next-steps>Contribution &amp; Next Steps</h2><p>I created a video and draft website to launch the new and improved hello.p5js.org. Before going live, I will coordinate with Processing to ensure the site’s content meets the Processing foundations’ standards. I will also make sure it loads properly across devices.</p><p>Dropbox folder (for video files): <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vcr58ughgedaj0k/AAC9y13UjjiMuXdcYKxaVmCOa?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vcr58ughgedaj0k/AAC9y13UjjiMuXdcYKxaVmCOa?dl=0</a></p><p>Github Repo: <a href=https://github.com/emclaren/hello-p5>https://github.com/emclaren/hello-p5</a></p><h2 id=acknowledgements>Acknowledgements</h2><p>I would like to thank my mentor Evelyn Masso, and Lauren McCarthy for their support and feedback. I would also like to acknowledge the awesome community members who volunteered to be a part of this project.</p><p>I learned so much while working on this project - thanks to the Processing foundation for having me on the team.</p></main><div>p5.js site footer goes here</div></body></html>
