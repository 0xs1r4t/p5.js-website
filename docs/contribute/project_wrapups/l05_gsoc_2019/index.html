In this process, I created a small toolkit of p5-based GUI elements and a node.js server template for multi-person interactive games. Check out an example of one such experience <a href="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/706438411.webp?mw=1100&mh=619&q=70">here</a>.</p><p><em>Sidenote: my next <em>p5.js</em> project is to package and release a multi-player node.js server and client template along with a tutorial!</em></p><p><a href=https://vimeo.com/274410221><img alt="Space Dander Example Video" src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/706438411.webp?mw=1100&mh=619&q=70"/></a></p><p>During my graduate studies at UCLA’s Design Media Arts department, I had the wonderful opportunity to work as a teaching assistant for Lauren McCarthy and Casey Reas, who both taught <em>p5.js</em> in their classes. I noticed that students often had difficulty with GUI elements in their projects; building a simple button in <em>p5.js</em> is an excellent learning exercise if the primary focus of an assignment, but it can be a blocker if the assignment goals are to express some larger creative vision.</p><p>Having already created my own personal toolkit of project-specific GUI elements, I realized that with some work, I could adapt it into a more generalized tool that may be useful to students, artists, and educators. And so the process began…</p><h3 id=research>Research</h3><p>My first step in working on <em>p5.touchgui</em> was to research GUI design methodologies and examples. I looked at the current state of UI within <em>p5.js</em>. Users must either use DOM elements via <em>p5.dom</em> or create their own canvas-based GUI objects with <em>p5.js</em>.</p><p>I performed a number of preliminary tests with DOM elements and multi-touch screens, and it seemed DOM elements were not well suited to multi-touch environments: the performance was often slow and touch quality inconsistent. DOM elements seemed sufficient for simple interactions but not for more dynamic experiences such as touch-screen controllers.</p><p>While <em>p5.dom</em> gives users access to DOM elements, it still feels a bit clunky to use. In my classroom experiences, <em>p5.dom</em> often seemed a pain point for many students trying to use DOM elements in their sketches.</p><p>As my focus shifted towards designing canvas-based GUI tools, I became especially interested in learning about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_Mode_GUI>Immediate-Mode</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode>Retained-Mode</a> approaches to Graphical User Interfaces. I first learned of these categories from reading <a href=http://www.doekewartena.nl/ >Doeke Wartena</a>’s description of his Processing GUI library, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1qyvQsjK5Y">this video</a> by Casey Muratori on Immediate-Mode GUIs was particularly illuminating. I decided to dive into creating <em>p5.touchgui</em> as an Immediate-Mode GUI.</p><h3 id=immediate-mode-p5touchgui>Immediate-Mode p5.touchgui</h3><p>I first implemented a version of <em>p5.touchgui</em> using an Immediate-Mode approach, and in many ways, it felt simple and easy-to-use. The GUI Objects were not stored anywhere; they were fed a variable when drawn, and they modified that variable by reference based on user input.</p><p>Here’s what the code looked like in the Immediate-Mode version:</p><pre class="astro-code github-dark" style=background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8;overflow-x:auto tabindex=0><code><span class=line><span style=color:#f97583>let</span><span style=color:#e1e4e8> x;</span></span>

For instance, users can access GuiObject member variables such as <code>button.isPressed</code>, which returns a <code>Boolean</code> value describing if the button is in fact pressed.</p><p>By creating callback event handlers specifically for the library, I was also able to account for both mouse and multi-touch input. These custom handlers not only enable expected mouse behavior such as hover states and multi-touch control of GUI objects, but they don’t interfere at all with the built-in <em>p5.js</em> event callbacks (e.g. <em>mousePressed()</em>, <em>touchStarted()</em>, etc.). Building the input processing around event-based handlers also made it significantly more performant than calculating inputs during every single frame.</p><p>By switching to a Retained-Mode approach, I was able to begin implementing a style system for GuiObjects, building a small set of presets, and providing user-accessible functions for modifying object styles.</p><p>Here’s what the code looks like now:</p><pre class="astro-code github-dark" style=background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8;overflow-x:auto tabindex=0><code><span class=line><span style=color:#f97583>let</span><span style=color:#e1e4e8> gui;</span></span>

On further reflection, this is not surprising given that <em>p5.js</em> is essentially a Canvas object, a buffer of pixels. This pixel buffer and the elements within it inherently carry none of the data screen readers are able to access in DOM elements.</p><p>I am interested in working with the <em>p5.js</em> community to find ways of making both <em>p5.touchgui</em> and <em>p5.js</em> more accessible, whether through providing off-screen shadow DOM structures or through solutions such as the Accessibility Object Model (AOM).</p><h3 id=style>Style</h3><p>Style is one area where <em>p5.touchgui</em> needs more work; as it turns out, it’s hard to build a style system that balances customizability with simplicity! The presets are a good start, and it is possible to stylize individual objects, but the number of lines of code it would take to build out a larger interface still seem extraneous.</p><p>Some features I think would help:</p><ul><li><em>Group styling</em> - i.e. determining the style of an entire object class. This is a high priority feature to be added to the library.</li><li><em>Simplified style properties</em> - the properties currently get pretty granular, which on one hand gives a lot of color control and on the other means that a non-trivial number of properties need to be set. I am very interested in the simplery way Material UI has primary and secondary color choices, for instance.</li><li>More presets!</li></ul><h3 id=additional-guiobjects-and-features>Additional GuiObjects and Features</h3><p>There are a number of additional features on which I would like to work:</p><ul><li>More GuiObjects!<ul><li>Radio Button</li><li>Color Picker</li><li>Button Bank</li><li>Slider Bank</li><li>Range Slider</li><li>Text Field</li></ul></li><li>Tags (grouping GuiObjects by tag)</li><li>Selective Input Lock (right now all GuiObjects default to input lock)</li><li>Migrate reference documentation to Docsify model.</li><li>More examples!</li></ul><p>You can also check out my <a href=https://github.com/L05/p5.touchgui/blob/main/docs/NOTES/ >development notes</a> if you’d like to read a more informal summary of process and interests.</p><h2 id=-support>&gt; Support</h2><p>Please use <em>p5.touchgui</em> and give me feedback!</p><ul><li>If you <strong>use it in a project</strong>, what works and doesn’t work?</li><li>If you <strong>teach it in a class</strong>, what works and doesn’t work?</li></ul><p>Any questions pertaining to this project may be communicated via Issues on the <a href=https://github.com/L05/p5.touchgui>p5.touchgui GitHub repository</a>.
