oneLineDescription: Load multiple resources asynchronously before drawing.
---

This example demonstrates how to use
<a href="https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/async_await/" target="_blank"> async/await </a>
together with
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all" target="_blank">Promise.all()</a>

Three random images are fetched asynchronously from the internet.
After all images finish loading, they are drawn together on the canvas.
Using
<a href="https://beta.p5js.org/reference/p5/loadimage/" target="_blank">loadImage()</a>
wrapped inside a promise allows better control over loading multiple resources efficiently.
