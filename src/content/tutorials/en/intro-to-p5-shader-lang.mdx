# Introduction to Shaders 2.0

In this tutorial, we will be exploring the p5.js shading language. This language is a simplified version of GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is used in WebGL. Shaders are programs that run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, sometimes known as a 'graphcs card') and are used to render graphics. They are used to create effects that are difficult to achieve with the traditional rendering pipeline. 

Practically, most of the effects that you can create with shaders can be achieved with the p5.js, but shaders can be more efficient and can be used to create more complex effects. Additionally, any effect you make with shaders can be used for different objects: for example, one shader which creates a wavy effect can be used on multiple objects, and the effect will be consistent across all of them.

## What is a Shader?

A shader is a program that runs on the GPU. There are two types of shaders: vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders are used to transform the vertices of a shape, while fragment shaders are used to determine the color of each pixel in a shape. Both are required to render anything in WebGL mode. Fortunately, p5.js provides some default shaders that you can use, so you don't have to write your own shaders if you don't want to. Take the following sketch...

<EditableSketch code={`
let myShader;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200, WEBGL);


}

function draw() {
  {/* shader(myShader); */}
  background(220);
  orbitControl();
  lights();
  sphere(80);
}
`} />

A shader is caculating the lighting and shading of the blue fill, and another shader is drawing the stroke. 

Previously, if you wanted to write your own shaders, you would have to use the `createShader()` and `loadShader()` functions. However, with the release of p5.js 2.0, you can now modify the existing shaders in p5.js. This means you can modify the shaders that are used to render shapes, strokes, and filters. This is useful because it reduces the steps needed to get started writing shaders, and the need for boilerplate code.
