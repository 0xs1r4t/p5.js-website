  <p>Sets the perspective projection matrix.</p>

  <p>This method modifies the current matrix to represent a perspective
  projection.

  Perspective projection is commonly used in 3D graphics to simulate the effect

  of objects appearing smaller as they move further away from the camera.</p>

  <p>The perspective matrix is defined by the field of view (fovy), aspect
  ratio,

  and the near and far clipping planes. The near and far clipping planes define

  the range of depth that will be rendered, with anything outside this range

  being clipped.</p>

    // Setting a perspective projection matrix

    const matrix = new p5.Matrix(4); // Create a 4x4 identity matrix

    matrix.perspective(Math.PI / 4, 1.5, 0.1, 100); // Set perspective
    projection

    console.log(matrix.matrix);
