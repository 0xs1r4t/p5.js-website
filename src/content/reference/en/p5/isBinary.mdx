  <p>This function checks if the file is in ASCII format or in Binary format</p>

  <p>It is done by searching keyword <code>solid</code> at the start of the
  file.</p>

  <p>An ASCII STL data must begin with <code>solid</code> as the first six
  bytes.

  However, ASCII STLs lacking the SPACE after the <code>d</code> are known to be

  plentiful. So, check the first 5 bytes for <code>solid</code>.</p>

  <p>Several encodings, such as UTF-8, precede the text with up to 5 bytes:

  Search for <code>solid</code> to start anywhere after those prefixes.</p>
