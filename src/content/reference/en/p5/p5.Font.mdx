  textToPoints:
    description: >
      <p>Returns an array of points outlining a string of text written using the

      font.</p>

      <p>Each point object in the array has three properties that describe the

      point's location and orientation, called its path angle. For example,

      <code>{ x: 10, y: 20, alpha: 450 }</code>.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>str</code>, is a string of text. The second
      and third

      parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, are the text's position. By
      default, they set the

      coordinates of the bounding box's bottom-left corner. See

      <a href="/reference/p5/textAlign/">textAlign()</a> for more ways to align
      text.</p>

      <p>The fourth parameter, <code>options</code>, is also optional.
      <code>font.textToPoints()</code>

      expects an object with the following properties:</p>

      <p><code>sampleFactor</code> is the ratio of the text's path length to the
      number of

      samples. It defaults to 0.1. Higher values produce more points along the

      path and are more precise.</p>

      <p><code>simplifyThreshold</code> removes collinear points if it's set to
      a number other

      than 0. The value represents the threshold angle to use when determining

      whether two edges are collinear.</p>

  textToContours:
    description: >
      <p>Returns an array of arrays of points outlining a string of text written
      using the

      font. Each array represents a contour, so the letter O will have two outer
      arrays:

      one for the outer edge of the shape, and one for the inner edge of the
      hole.</p>

      <p>Each point object in a contour array has three properties that describe
      the

      point's location and orientation, called its path angle. For example,

      <code>{ x: 10, y: 20, alpha: 450 }</code>.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>str</code>, is a string of text. The second
      and third

      parameters, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, are the text's position. By
      default, they set the

      coordinates of the bounding box's bottom-left corner. See
