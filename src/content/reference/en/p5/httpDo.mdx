  <p>Method for executing an HTTP request. If data type is not specified,

  it will default to <code>'text'</code>.</p>

  <p>This function is meant for more advanced usage of HTTP requests in p5.js.
  It is

  best used when a <code>Request</code>

  object is passed to the <code>path</code> parameter.</p>

  <p>This method is suitable for fetching files up to size of 64MB when "GET" is
  used.</p>
