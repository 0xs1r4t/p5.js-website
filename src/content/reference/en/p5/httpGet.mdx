  Method for executing an HTTP GET request. If data type is not specified,
  it will default to <code>'text'</code>. This is equivalent to
  calling <code>httpDo(path, 'GET')</code>. The 'binary' datatype will return
  a Blob object, and the 'arrayBuffer' datatype will return an ArrayBuffer
  which can be used to initialize typed arrays (such as Uint8Array).
