  <p>Sets the property of a curve.</p>

  <p>For example, set tightness,

  use <code>splineProperty('tightness', t)</code>, with <code>t</code> between 0
  and 1,

  at 0 as default.</p>

  <p>Spline curves are like cables that are attached to a set of points.

  Adjusting tightness adjusts how tightly the cable is

  attached to the points. The parameter, tightness, determines

  how the curve fits to the vertex points. By default,

  tightness is set to 0. Setting tightness to 1, as in

  <code>splineProperty('tightness', 1)</code>, connects the curve's points

  using straight lines. Values in the range from â€“5 to 5

  deform curves while leaving them recognizable.</p>

  <p>This function can also be used to set 'ends' property

  (see also: the <a href="/reference/p5/curveDetail/">curveDetail()</a>
  example),

  such as: <code>splineProperty('ends', EXCLUDE)</code> to exclude

  vertices, or <code>splineProperty('ends', INCLUDE)</code> to include them.</p>
