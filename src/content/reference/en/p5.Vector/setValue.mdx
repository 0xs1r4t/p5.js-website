  <p>Sets the value at the specified index of the vector.</p>

  <p>This method allows you to change a specific component of the vector by
  providing its index and the new value you want to set.

  Think of the vector as a list of numbers, where each number represents a
  different direction (like x, y, or z).

  The index is just the position of the number in that list.</p>

  <p>For example, if you have a vector with values [0, 20, 30], and you want to
  change the second value (20) to 50,

  you would use this method with index 1 (since indexes start at 0) and value
  50.</p>
