  <p>Retrieves the value at the specified index from the vector.</p>

  <p>This method allows you to get the value of a specific component of the
  vector

  by providing its index. Think of the vector as a list of numbers, where each

  number represents a different direction (like x, y, or z). The index is just

  the position of the number in that list.</p>

  <p>For example, if you have a vector with values 10, 20, 30 the index 0 would

  give you the first value 10, index 1 would give you the second value 20,

  and so on.</p>
