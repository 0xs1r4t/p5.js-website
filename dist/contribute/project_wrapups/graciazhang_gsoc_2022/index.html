She has archived and visualized workshops, classes and relevant materials to better provide the community with access to education-related resources.</p><p>In this project, I updated the posts based on the recent submission form first to be familiar with the original /Teach and to research the user through the submitted forms. Based on user studies, I intend to bring more learners &amp; diversity on /teach page by optimizing the submission form with a new form for learners who want to share and a new section “Upcoming Workshops”. Inhwa and I hope that this new section will bring in more willing learners and give more teachers the opportunity to share their workshops, classes, etc.</p><h2 id=updating-posts>Updating posts</h2><h3 id=screening-the-submission-forms-for-the-last-two-years>Screening the submission forms for the last two years</h3><h4 id=1filter-unpublishable-contents>1)Filter unpublishable contents</h4><p>-the answer in the spreadsheet doesn’t seem like a full version. -filled the form up with unrelated contents.</p><h4 id=2update-the-other-contents>2)Update the other contents.</h4><p>-updated with 12 filtered contents in yaml file. -added the corresponding model box for each of the 12 new posts.</p><ul><li><p>Teach Page Rebasing Pull Request: <a href=https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/1245>https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/1245</a></p></li><li><p>Teach Page Posts Update Pull Request: <a href=https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/1249>https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/1249</a></p></li></ul><h2 id=uiux-design>UI/UX Design</h2><p>Besides the specific UI/UX changes below, I also proposed an issue in processing/p5.js-website about the overall structural changes to enhance the user experience.<a href=https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/1250>#1250</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=veiw&id=1r-wriIvnOPLL6G-ihrL-9wOSEOKfY7l3"/></p><h4 id=1upcoming-workshops>1)Upcoming Workshops</h4><p>Following the original UI style, I used a combination of banners and headers to present the new workshops to guarantee accessibility.

I have to say, I looooove Inhwa as my mentor!!! I am a beginner in front-end and she helped me a lot throughout the GSoC project in every way. I couldn’t have completed my project without her help. She encouraged me when I was hesitant about the direction, and explained in detail when I had problems with the code. She is both my mentor and my friend!</p><p>I would also like to thank Saber and Qianqian.The discussion with them about education has been very profitable and I have a more solid idea about my project.</p></main><div>p5.js site footer goes here</div></body></html>
