codebase and making it more readable for the future contributors to the project.</p><p>I reviewed a few PRs, added a comment on a Decoupling Issue and worked on a few tasks as mentioned below.</p><ul><li><p>I solved an existing issue in FES, I worked on a language translation for FES which was Hindi Language, I updated the Readme and contributor guidelines for p5.js in order to make

State of The Project</h2><p>I am currently working on a task that involves creating a Readme inside the FES  folder.</p><p>This task would help the contributors to get directly acclimatized with FES at the place where they will be going through the code of FES.</p><p>This task also includes a flowchart diagram which references the FES functions and their uses in various files throughout p5.js.</p><p>The remaining part of this task is to make the flowchart more readable at the first glance</p><h2 id=whats-left-to-do>What’s Left to Do</h2><p>As of now the project is in a good state to get started with; without any initial setup issues.</p><p>The next steps would include refactoring the existing files of FES  folder so as to make it more readable for first time code contributors. As of now, the code is a bit complex to understand at first glance.</p><p>Moreover, some other areas of improvement would include improving the documentation of FES more, as we progress through the project.</p><p>Also, solving FES issues along the way is another task to be taken up by future contributors.</p><p>One long term goal of the FES project would be to decouple it, as discussed here.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, my GSoC experience was amazing and it helped me grow personally as well as professionally due to its nature of being open source.</p><p>I believe there were a few challenges that I faced, which involved setting up the project initially on my machine(issue here).</p><p>The next set of challenges involved navigating through the vast set of codebase and finding what I required(I believe I have solved that to some extent with my current contributions).</p><p>During this summer, I learned how p5.js open source community functions through various communication channels like Discourse and mailing lists.</p><p>One plus point of this summer was me learning about a new tool called Mermaid for generating diagrams.</p><p>Literally every doubt I had, was answered either on Github itself or on mails.</p><p>I would continue contributing to the Processing Organisation and would even love to mentor other GSoC Students in the future.</p><p>I would suggest the future contributors to be free of worries about any lack of support from the mentors and Processing in general, everything is answered well on time and is pretty well managed.</p></main><div>p5.js site footer goes here</div></body></html>
