The main objective in GSoC 2018 was to lay down a basic structure of the app which will act as a foundation for future developments and will provide an idea about the app to the teacher community and future contributors.</p><p>The three core objectives of the web app are-</p><ol><li>Teachers should be able to create, present, save and share lessons which make use of interactive visualisations.</li><li>Teachers should be able to collaborate with programmers to produce new visualisations.</li><li>Students should be able to view the video lessons prepared by teachers and should be able to use the simulations the same time they watch it.</li></ol><h2 id=link-to-the-webapp>Link to the webapp</h2><p><a href=http://dynamiclearning.io>http://dynamiclearning.io</a></p><h2 id=link-to-github-repo>Link to Github repo</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/JithinKS97/dynamic-learning-app>https://github.com/JithinKS97/dynamic-learning-app</a></p><h2 id=how-to-set-up-the-development-environment>How to set up the development environment</h2><ol><li>Install Meteor.js - <a href=https://www.meteor.com/ >https://www.meteor.com/</a></li><li>Install git</li><li>Clone the dynamic-learning-app repository</li><li>Install the node dependencies by executing the command <code>meteor npm install --save</code> from the root directory</li><li>Start the app with the command <code>meteor</code> and the app will start running in localhost:3000 (By default)</li></ol><h2 id=frameworks-used>Frameworks used</h2><p>The webapp is build on top of full stack Javascript framework Meteor.js along with React.js. Meteor.js comes with inbuilt Mongo DB database which is used in the app. Semantic UI React is used for obtaining styled ui components used throughout for making the ui of the app.</p><h2 id=main-react-components>Main React components</h2><p>Below are the main React components of the app and much of the work in GSoC 2018 was focused on the development of these React components. These main React page components can be found in ‘imports/ui/pages’.</p><p>The routes of each of the pages can be found in the ‘clients/routes’ directory. Detailed documentation for each of the components are provided in the components’ js files.</p><h3 id=1-lessonplan-creator>1) Lessonplan creator</h3><h5 id=component---createlessonplan>Component - CreateLessonPlan</h5><p>This is the area where teachers create the lessonplans. It is basically a drawing app on which simulations can be embedded and annotations can be made. Each lessonplan consists of a sequence of slides which is implemented as an array. Each element in the array consists of annotations of string type and an array of simulations.</p><p>Each simulation is an iframe which is obtained from the online p5 text editor export feature.</p><h3 id=2-login-and-signup-components>2) Login and Signup components</h3><h5 id=components---login-signup>Components - Login, Signup</h5><p>The login and sign up features are made by making use of the inbuilt authentication tools in Meteor.</p><h3 id=3-the-lessonplans-simulations-lessons-organization>3) The lessonplans, simulations, lessons organization</h3><h5 id=components---lessonplansdirectories-lessonsdirectories-simsdirectories>Components - LessonplansDirectories, LessonsDirectories, SimsDirectories</h5><p>React Sortable tree component (<a href=https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-sortable-tree>https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-sortable-tree</a>) is used for building the interface for the organization of lessonplans, lessons and the uploaded simulations.</p><h3 id=4-request-forum>4) Request Forum</h3><h5 id=component---request>Component - Request</h5><p>For each lessonplan, a request forum can be created by the teacher where a request for a new simulation can be made. These requests are visible to all the other users of the app and anyone logged in can participate in the discussion for the development of a new simulation.</p><h3 id=5-sharing-of-lessonplans-lessons-and-simulations>5) Sharing of lessonplans, lessons and simulations</h3><h5 id=components---sharedsims-sharedlessonplans-sharedlessons>Components - SharedSims, SharedLessonPlans, SharedLessons</h5><p>The users can share lessonplans, lessons and the simulations with the other users if they want. I’ve used the meteor easy search component for implementing the search (<a href=https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-easy-search>https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-easy-search</a>)</p><h3 id=6-creation-of-lessons>6) Creation of Lessons</h3><h5 id=component---lesson>Component - Lesson</h5><p>This is the component where we can create lessons. Each lesson consists of a series of slides and on each slide there will be a video and the associated simulations. When the creator of the lesson views the component, he/she will have options to edit the lesson (Add more slides, add video, add simulations) and for others, they can only view the lesson.</p><h3 id=7-exploring-the-app>7) Exploring the App</h3><h5 id=component---explore>Component - Explore</h5><p>Users who are not logged in visiting the app will be able to view all the lessons, lessonplans and request forums that have been created and shared with public so that they get an idea about the app.</p><h3 id=8-adding-simulations-and-the-communication-between-them-and-the-app>8) Adding simulations and the communication between them and the app</h3><h5 id=component---simcontainer>Component - SimContainer</h5><p>Simulations are added to the app by making use of the iframe export feature of the online p5 text editor. One of the challenges that I faced was the implementation of the communication between the webapp and the iframe. <a href=https://github.com/catarak>Cassie Tarakajian</a> helped me with this. She suggested me to use MessageChannel API and it worked. Another functionality I wanted to add was the ability to save the state of the simulations. This can be achieved by alloting a Javascript object for each of the simulation in the database. The Javascript object can be saved and loaded using MessageChannel.</p><h4 id=above-are-the-main-react-components-of-the-app-and-you-can-find-the-other-react-components-in-theimportsuicomponents-folder>Above are the main React Components of the app and you can find the other React Components in the’imports/ui/components’ folder.</h4><p>I’ve provided necessary documentations in the components’ js files in all the areas where I felt like clarifications are necessary.</p><h2 id=features-that-can-be-added>Features that can be added</h2><ol><li><p>In GSoC 2018, my main target was to develop the overall basic structure of the application on top of which further development can be done. I haven’t given much emphasis on the design aspects and didn’t go much into the styling (The Components of Semantic UI React comes up with the essential styles that are needed). The app needs a general styling template.</p></li><li><p>Unit testing - Apart from some server side tests, no tests have been written. Adequate test cases for the server side and client side code should be written, so that the future contributors can add features without breaking the existing code.</p></li><li><p>Enhancing the discussion forum- The forums area can be enhanced by providing more features like providing Avatars for each users and the ability to reply to the comments, voting for the comments etc.</p></li><li><p>Adding Comments forum for the lessons.</p></li><li><p>Profile page for the users and notifications.</p></li><li><p>Login and Signup using Github, Google, email verification, password recovery.</p></li><li><p>Smoothening of the canvas strokes- At present, there are no smoothening algorithms for the strokes in the canvas due to which they appear to be a little jagged.</p></li><li><p>Making the webapp responsive.</p></li></ol><p>For feature enhancements, bug reports and contributions, email me to <a href=mailto:jithunni.ks@gmail.com>jithunni.ks@gmail.com</a></p><h2 id=acknowledgement>Acknowledgement</h2><p>I’m extremely thankful to Processing Foundation for having the faith in me and giving me an opportunity to start the project.
